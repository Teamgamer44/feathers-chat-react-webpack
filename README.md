# feathers-chat-react-webpack

This is a complete build of the [feathers-chat tutorial](https://docs.feathersjs.com/getting-started/readme.html), expanded to include webpack
and react.

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

I completed this as a challenge to myself, and wrote a tutorial on how I did it. Find the how to [here](https://medium.com/@jameskelsey/react-with-feathers-js-a-tutorial-for-newbies-by-a-newbie-d2725e7cad73#.bkteaduju)

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/feathers-chat-2; npm install
    ```

3. Start the app

    ```
    npm start
    ```
4. Running `npm run build` will bundle react using webpack in watch mode.

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.
I haven't included any additional tests.
